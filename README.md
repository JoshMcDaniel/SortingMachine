# SortingMachine
Java program that calculates the number of fruits and vegetables in an Array List and prints the quantities.

So hereâ€™s the problem.

Sally goes out each weekend to pick fruit and vegetables from her garden. 
She carries a basket with her, reaches her hand out to the various fruits and vegetables, and places them into the basket. 
Sally wants to be able to dump the contents of the basket into a sorting machine that will separate the fruits from the vegetables.

Can you design the software for a machine that Sally can use to sort fruits from vegetables 
and then print the sum of either fruits or vegetables?
